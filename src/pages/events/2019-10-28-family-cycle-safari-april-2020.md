You may have heard about our amazing sponsored bike rides through Malawi over the last 2 years.  Would you like to join us next year?  We have developed a new ride – perfect for families or individuals who want a gentle introduction to Africa.  This will provide a unique opportunity to experience some amazing African wildlife, bush breakfasts, giant baobab trees and ancient cave paintings, whilst also enabling you to visit some of the Charity’s development projects (the permaculture garden, health clinic and orphan schools) and sleep in Sam’s Village, which is an eco-built training centre, surrounded by traditional Malawi villages.



There is a PDF available here with more about the trip or just click on the poster below. 



 We are holding an ‘Information Meeting’ on Sunday 24th November in Surbiton, to answer any questions, meet previous participants and members of the 2020 team, at which light refreshments will be served and a film of a previous bike ride shown.  (For more information, simply send an email to: sara.butterfield@africanvision.org.uk )



Get inspired by watching the 2019 Video here!!



We have an adult only ride too,  more info here
