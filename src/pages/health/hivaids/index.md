Many children are orphaned due to HIV/AIDS and are left to be looked after by their extended family, often their grandparents. People are aware of HIV and it is taught in school, but with limited contraception and availability of ARV medication it still is very prevalant.

We are encouraging HIV+ support groups to have good nutrition with our ‘well-being programme’. They are trained on the 5 food groups and we assist in helping them to grow a variety of vegetables and fruit trees. We work with 40 HIV + people and they are also linked with NASFAM (National Smallholder Farmers’ Association of Malawi) who now support them.

Here are some photos of one of the HIV+ support groups in their vegetable garden.  They both eat the vegetables and sell them, making this a truly sustainable project.
