The under 5’s are one of our most vulnerable groups -11% never reach the age of 5 years old. They often die through dysentary from drinking dirty water, or malaria. To build up their immune system along with supporting their overall physical and mental growth, we have set up 9 pre-schools (CBCCs) with attached feeding centres. Each child is fed a nutritional porridge each day, five days a week. Their weight and height is monitored. This food is donated to us by Feed the Children, Malawi.

Feed The Children are however phasing out these porridge donations.

We are helping the local communities to set up sustainable feeding gardens, where we will grow a combination of soya, groundnuts, maize and millet that can be fed to the children. Find out more..
