centres

We work in an area some 30km from the capital city, Lilongwe which is 400km squared and with 45,000 population. We support 26 Primary Schools, have just under 3,000 orphans and 300 disabled registered with 2 clinics and 2 maternity units. We work through 14 Centres where we have a Local Based Committee of 7 volunteers in each Centre who help us see and resolve the issues.
