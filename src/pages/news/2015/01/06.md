The walk will still be on Sunday, 8 February but will now visit Nonsuch Park (<span style="text-decoration: underline;">NOT</span> Headley Heath). Meet at 11:00 at The Wheatsheaf pub in Ewell for coffee and croissants then on for a 11:30 am start. The cost will be £5 a head for the walk (children under 16 free – a bargain!). Then back to the Wheatsheaf in Ewell for an optional snack at £5 and drinks.

The walk should take around 2 hours).  [All details, including post codes, can be found on the Events page](http://www.africanvision.org.uk/event/project-4-africa-walk/ "Project 4 Africa Walk").

This change has been brought about by the condition of the proposed Headley Heath walk at this time of year. Apologies for any inconvenience caused.
