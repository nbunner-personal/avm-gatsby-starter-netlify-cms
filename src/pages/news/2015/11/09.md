Launching our "A Child is Born" Christmas Campaign 2015!

We aim to raise £15,000 which will be doubled by matched funds to £30,000.

The purpose of the campaign is to build a waiting home for new mothers at the recently completed maternity unit in M'bang'gombe.

Malawi has the highest rate of pre-term births in the world, 18.1%; due to mothers having persistent malaria, HIV and malnourishment.

Globally, prematurity is the leading cause of death in children under the age of 5\. The waiting home will provide nutritional training to mothers in attendance as well as resolve complications which emerge in the latter stages of pregnancy. In Malawi, official statistics for malnutrition are alarmingly high with most statistics showing very little improvement over the last 30 years. About half of all children under the age of five show signs of chronic malnutrition with an estimated 48% being stunted (too short for their age), 31% underweight (too thin for their age), and 11% wasted (too thin for their height). One third of the population is food insecure in terms of energy, resulting in further disrupted eating patterns and reduced food intake.
