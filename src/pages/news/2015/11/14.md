[Goats, nets and boreholes](#store)
[Old laptops and cameras](#laptops)
[Donate monthly](#monthly)
[Easy Fundraise](#easyfundraising)
[Volunteer](#volunteers)
[Gift a legacy](#gift)

* Support our A Child is Born campaign to raise £30,000 to build a Waiting Home at the M'bang'ombe Maternity Unit.

* Donate £100 to repair our minibus windscreen.  We use the minibus as the only form of transport available to take our disability patients to appointments in Lilongwe.  With the rainy season starting there is unfortunately every possibility that the windscreen will shatter soon.

* Run the [London Marathon](https://www.africanvision.org.uk/2015/11/12/run-the-london-marathon-for-malawi/).  We have a place available - are you the person to take it up?  [Email](mailto:info@africanvision.org.uk) us!

* Sponsor a university or further education student.  Students who have completed our secondary school scholarship programme are now studying Teaching, Nursing, Languages and Journalism.  £40 a month will help support them.  [Read more here](https://www.africanvision.org.uk/projects/university-scholarships/).

* Do you know any UK pre-schools who would like to partner a Malawian pre-school in our area?  [Email](mailto:info@africanvision.org.uk) us if so!

* Buy 2016 Calendars in our [Store](https://www.africanvision.org.uk/shop/).

* Buy a goat, mosquito net or borehole for Malawi in our [Store](https://www.africanvision.org.uk/shop/).  Ideal feel-good birthday gift!

* Do you have an old laptop or camera you could donate to us?  We are always in need of laptops for the Lilongwe office and our sponsored University Students. If your laptop is less than 5 years old, we can gladly take it off your hands. We also need cameras so that we can record project progress for Monitoring and Evaluation and to report back to funders on the spending and impact of their funds. Mobile phones which have chargers and are unblocked are very useful too. [Email](mailto:info@africanvision.org.uk) us if you can help!

* Set up a monthly donation to support any and all of our work.

Can you help us in any of these ways?  Thank you!
