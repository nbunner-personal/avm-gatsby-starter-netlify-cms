This evening's Celebration Exhibition at the cornerHOUSE raised over £1000!

Thank you to all of you who supported the evening.  The £1000+ goes to our projects with orphans and vulnerable people in Malawi.

Gifts, Christmas cards, 2016 calendars and artwork were all on sale.

The artwork and calendars were created by Graphic Design students from Kingston College.  Here's Josh Bullen with his artwork "Early Years Education", which sold on the evening.  The artwork for the calendars is very striking and very impressive work from the students.
