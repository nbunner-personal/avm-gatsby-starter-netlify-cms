Eileen Speak, who came to Malawi with us last year, and is coming again this April, had a brilliant fundraiser at her house last week. There was food, laughter, chatting, music, tombola, bring and buy bottles, fun and awareness raising and it was absolutely brilliant.

She raised over £700 for Landirani and everyone had a lovely evening so big thank you to Eileen and everyone who came to the evening and gave so generously.
