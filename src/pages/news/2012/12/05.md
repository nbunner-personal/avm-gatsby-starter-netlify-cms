12th December 2012 is one of those special dates which you are never likely to see again...please do something special for this once in a lifetime event?

At 12 minutes past 12 on the 12th December 2012, make a donation of £12 at [https://mydonate.bt.com/fundraisers/twelvechanges ](https://mydonate.bt.com/fundraisers/twelvechanges)which will provide 12 meals or 12 fruit trees for orphan and vulnerable children in Malawi.

Make it a special 12th day of Christmas and make someone smile this Christmas!
