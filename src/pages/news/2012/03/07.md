We are looking for volunteers to take part in our very first **eco-project in Malawi** 8th – 29th September 2012.

Would you be interested?

For the past ten years, [AidCamps International](https://www.aidcamps.org "Aid Camps International") has been taking groups of volunteers to developing countries to work on a variety of aid projects, which their fundraising helped to finance - but this is our first really ‘green’ project.

We are planning the construction of a thatched, rammed-earth building of traditional design, which will be used as a Community Based Children’s Centre in the village of M’teza. The Centre will provide essential services for the many orphans in this village, including a pre-school, a daily meal for the under 5s (funded by Feed the Children) and psychosocial support for the under 18s. The building will be weatherproof, hygienic and durable – and the materials will come from sustainable sources. You will also have the satisfaction of knowing that the project will make a real difference to the lives of hundreds of children in this extremely poor village.

Although the major cities in Malawi are developing very quickly, the vast majority of the population live in abject poverty in the rural areas. Many have lost one, or both, parents to HIV/AIDS.
Please help us to help these children get a good start in life by providing access to education and one nutritious meal a day.

Every child needs hope for the future

**Qualifications needed to become a volunteer with AidCamps International?**

****None! But you must be over 18, in good health, culturally sensitive and be happy to live and work as an enthusiastic member of a like-minded group of 10 – 15 volunteers.

**What will it cost?**

A Registration Fee of £395 pays for your accommodation, transport in Malawi and food for the three weeks. It also includes the cost of a weekend trip to Lake Malawi. Flights to and from Malawi are not included.
In addition, you will need to make a minimum donation of £900 towards the cost of the project. We encourage volunteers to fundraise to meet their costs.
