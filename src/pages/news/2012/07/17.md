Kelly’s 100km bike ride - We will be getting an update from Kelly shortly as to how much she raised and some pictures...so please watch this space.

You can still sponsor Kellie for her 100km cycle ride at [https://mydonate.bt.com/fundraisers/kellienolan1](https://mydonate.bt.com/fundraisers/kellienolan1). She had never done anything like this before and cycled from Richmond Bridge to Windsor... and back again...some feat for a novice!
