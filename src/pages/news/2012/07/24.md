Our latest build, the Rammed Earth CBCC, has now been completed, see pictures of the building work below (pictures of the completed building are in a later report).  Aid Camps International have funded this work and it was completed late September 2012.  They (ACI) had a group of volunteers who contributed to the build by going out in early September for 3 weeks and helped on the final build.
