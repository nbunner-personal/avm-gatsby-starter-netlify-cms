Heather’s abseil was very successfull, ‘frighteningly’ well in fact! On July 7th, she abseiled down the highest purpose made tower in the UK; at 400ft this is the height of the London Eye!

She has a new video to look at on YouTube at the link: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dzeUeeQ75fY&feature=plcp](https://landirani.createsend1.com/t/y-l-jylhmd-thiidddik-s/ "https://landirani.createsend1.com/t/y-l-jylhmd-thiidddik-s/")

She has raised £2000 so far towards a CBBC borehole...but another £2000 is needed to finish the job! This is not something that she had done before and she can still be sponsored at [https://mydonate.bt.com/fundraisers/heathersabseil](https://mydonate.bt.com/fundraisers/heathersabseil)
