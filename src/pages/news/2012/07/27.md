Great news - remember Kondwani who has cerebral palsy? (scroll down the 'News' page to ['Disability Register established'](http://www.landirani.org/news/2012/05/21/disability-register-established/ "Disability Register established") for his story) Well, he has now been referred to hospital and we have a donor who is supporting him.  They will now be making an individually made wheelchair with body support and a table for him to use. This will be ready soon and we will post some pictures when he receives it.

This will not only benefit Kondwani but his whole family.
