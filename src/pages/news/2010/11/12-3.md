A total of 20 wells have been built up and protected this year.

We are in the process of installing 8 more water harvesters in schools.

Four pumps have been installed on existing protected wells but there is an issue with parts so this is yet to be completed.

The composting toilets at Chitedze II is now complete and we hope other communities and schools will see the benefits soon and start creating their own composting toilets.
