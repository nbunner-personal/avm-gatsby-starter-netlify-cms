It has been agreed that the Landirani Village will be called "Landirani Training Village" as it will be primarily an educational facility - from the planning through to the build and the final use of the village.

We are in the process of arranging the move of the shipping container we bought 2yrs ago. This will be the first building project on site and will be opened as an information centre for the local communities.
