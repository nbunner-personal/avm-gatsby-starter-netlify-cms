We now have 10 schools in the Reforestation Programme. All 10 schools have been trained by the Forestry Department and all have tree nurseries.

There are now 10 established wood lots at the schools. Each school was given enough polytubes and seeds to plant 2,000 seedlings. If successful Landirani then buys the seedlings to plant in other schools and the project becomes and income generating sustainable project.

50 fuel saving ovens have been built in our area to reduce deforestation and we are working with a field officer from Total Land Care to intorduce them into more communities.

Twelve schools have designated ground for a maize field to grow maize, beans and pumpkins for the orphan and vulnerable children in the school. They have all been given training on making compost so they are less reliant on bought chemical fertiliser.
