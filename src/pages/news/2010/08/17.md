Once again Tolworth Girls' have surpassed themselves with the third annual event "Landirani Day"

The girls had designed T-Shirts about Landirani and the water situation in Malawi which we judged on the day.

Edward Davey, MP, attended the event to open it and made a fantastic speech about the importance of water for everything in life. He also judged the T-Shirt competition and had a wander around the many fantastic stalls (including getting his palm read).

There was some fantastic entertainment this year, including dances and singing from the girls and a drumming circle.

The stalls this year were fantastically varied and we had a brilliant time going around them all. We particularly liked the henna tatooing from the girls.

The final part of the day held the water competition. The girls were in house teams and had to carry buckets of water over and under and through an obstacle course. Very funny but with the serious message of the importance of water, and how people in Malawi have to carry water from the borehole to their homes - no taps of convenience!
