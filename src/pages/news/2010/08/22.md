The Allan and Nesta Ferguson Charitable Trust has awarded us a £12,000 grant to develop community-based childcare centres in our area. 

We are setting up these centres to offer holistic support to children who have been affected by HIV/AIDS. They are aimed primarily at children who are too young to go to school and usually comprise of a pre-school, a feeding station and a Children's Corner for orphan and vulnerable children. (You can read more about Children's Corner's [HERE](/projects/#project-11))

Thank you so much to The Allan and Nesta Ferguson Charitable Trust and to our team in Malawi for working so hard to secure the funds and manage this project.
