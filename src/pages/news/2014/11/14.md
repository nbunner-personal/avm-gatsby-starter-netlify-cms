Earlier this year, we approached Kingston Art College to ask them to design our Christmas cards for 2014.  The students produced professional artwork and 5 wonderful designs were selected. They have an African Christmas design statement that shows the warmth of Malawi ‘The warm heart of Africa’.

They are only £2.50 for 5 cards of one design, or £5.00 for a selection pack of 10 (two of each design).  These can be ordered through [**this link**](http://www.africanvision.org.uk/shop/ "Store"), by phone via '020 8287 8169' or by emailing: [**info@africanvision.org.uk**](mailto:info@africanvision.org.uk)

**Do you know? Easy Fundraising - Such a brilliant idea!** If you order online, we get a percentage at no cost to you! A simple insurance renewal or Amazon purchase can earn us £10 or more. Just your name and email address is all you need to buy your Christmas presents [**through this link ...**](http://landirani.cmail2.com/t/y-l-iidred-drjttytkl-w/)
