The latest African Vision newsletter is now out! You can read it here ...  [September 2014 Newsletter](https://www.africanvision.org.uk/africa-vision-news/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/September-AVM-Newsletter-FINAL-20-Aug-2014.pdf "April 2014 Newsletter")

<span style="line-height: 1.5em;">We have just finished a great summer of events including successful fundraisers celebrating Malawi turning 50 and more recently a wonderful Music Festival last weekend. Many thanks to those who supported these events and we look forward to seeing you at the next ones very soon.</span>

There is a full update on the very exciting progress being made in Sam's Village which I hope you will enjoy. It is a year this month since Sam Hayes passed away and our thoughts are very much with his family at this time; we have no doubt that he would be very proud of what has been achieved in his memory. Please keep up the support for this project which will provide self-sufficiency to many generations to come ...[ see the donation progress](https://mydonate.bt.com/fundraisers/transcontinental2014)

Both Nigel and Heather will be in Malawi with the team there for most of the next month and will report back on the progress shortly afterwards.
