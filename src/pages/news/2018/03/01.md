Another year of wonderful retreats in the heart of the Loire Valley. Choose your week ... Breathe, Draw, Gather; Exploring Ashtanga Yoga; Zen Meditation and Yoga, Earth, Fire, Stone and Wood; Baking at the Farm ... or try more than one!

20% of the income goes to support the orphan and vulnerable children of Malawi, so do please support Sam in this new venture and have a wonderful treat for yourself!
