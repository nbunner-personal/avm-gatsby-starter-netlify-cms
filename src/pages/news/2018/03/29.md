Our first training course started in March 2018\. 12 trainees have been selected to be trained as tailors over the next 4 months. The training programme focuses on vulnerable and disadvantaged adults who are excluded members of the community, especially vulnerable women and people with disability.

We have partnered with the Malawi TEVETA (Technical, Entrepreneurial, Vocational Education and Training Authority), who will provide CBET (Competence Based Education and Training) Accredited Vocational training at Sam’s Village. This will result in the trainees obtaining a Certificate of Achievement.

Our objective for these vulnerable groups is to provide them with sustainability and self-sufficiency through vocational training so that they will be able to set up their own business or find paid work. This will also provide village communities with increased access to locally provided skilled services. Future courses include carpentry, solar, earth building and many others based on community needs.

It costs £300 to support a trainee through their training programme, if you are able to help towards this, please click Donate above. Thank you so much.
