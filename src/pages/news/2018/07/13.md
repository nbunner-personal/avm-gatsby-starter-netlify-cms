<span style="font-family: 'Helvetica',sans-serif; color: #565656;">We are delighted to announce that we have just signed a contract to become implementation partners with UNESCO which is managing part of the Skills and Technical Education Programme (STEP) in Malawi. STEP will be supporting bursaries for the next 18 months to train 150 marginalized people in different vocational skills. We are specifically focusing on a minimum of 50% women attendance. STEP is funded by the European Union.</span>

<span style="font-family: 'Helvetica',sans-serif; color: #565656;">We announced earlier that our first training course started in March 2018 where 12 trainees had been selected to be trained as tailors. Their training is now complete and we are very pleased that everybody passed their Level 1 certification for Tailoring. Ruth Desmond is our Tailoring trainer and has been inspirational in teaching 12 people all the skills needed to be a tailor and empowering them to become self-sufficient. Their graduation takes place on July 17th, where we also welcome the first group of trainees to be funded through STEP.</span>
