We have a profile on Mission Fish which is the official way to donate to charities when you make a sale though ebay.

If you do sell a lot and would like to donate between 10% and 100% to Landirani please follow the links to "donate to a charity of your choice" and search "Landirani" or "The Landirani Trust" and it will bring up our profile.

The cliche stands - every penny really does count and we are so grateful to anyone who choses to donate to us in this way.
