Last year we had a private party called September Sparkles which was a birthday party with live music, drumming and general fun, happiness and sparkles. We raised a lot of money from personal money donations instead of birthday pressies and the whole day/night was a great success.

Due to the success of this small event we have decided to hold a full festival open to the public.

Details of who will playing will follow but we will hve a very exciting line up of beautiful music, workshops and activities.

The event will be open to all the family and there will be a Neverland theme running through the day. Costumes are not compulsory but people will be dressed up and creating costumes, masks and having their faces painted so take this opportunity to do the same!

This is going to be a very exciting day and will raise lots of awareness and funds for Malawi!
