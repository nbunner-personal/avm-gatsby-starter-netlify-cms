Thank you so much to all the musicians who played at mini Landirani Live at The Grey Horse on Friday 18th Feb.

We raised over £600 for our water project and had such a fantastic evening.

Thank you to all who came and everyone who was involved in this magical evening....watch this space for more mini Landirani Lives and then in September we will have a full day festival LANDIRANI LIVE at a very special venue...
