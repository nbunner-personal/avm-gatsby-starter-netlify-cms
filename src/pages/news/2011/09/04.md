A note from Christine:

The half marathon is in Amsterdam on Sunday 16th October at 2pm. We have been training since February. The furthest I had run to that point was 10K (6.2 miles) so the thought of running 13.1 miles was daunting. We have gradually built up and over the last month have done 10, 11 and 12 mile runs. No records will be broken - the time limit is 3 hours on the day and I should do it in between 2.5 and 3 hours. 2 years ago when I started running I couldn't even do 100 meters so to complete a half marathon is an achievement. I thought I would try and raise money for Landirani if I could as I know you are only a small charity and all monies raised are put to good use in Malawi.
