**MANY HANDS MAKE AFRICAN QUILT**

Nearly 12 months ago,theGALLERY at Bishop's Castle in Shropshire held a fund raising evening for the benefit of the Landirani Trust - at the same time we launched a project to to create a patchwork quilt using colourful african fabrics and had a fantastic response from local artists and needleworkers who each made a 50cms patchwork square. Nine of these have now been sewn together by Clare Greig a local expert quiltmaker who also made a beautiful border which has transformed the x9 individual designs into a colourful and wonderfully unique quilt which perfectly showcases african fabric style and at the same time manages to evoke the community spirit and collabrorative nature of Landirani and it's links with Malawi. 

The Quilt is travelling between several exhibitions and venues in Shropshire and Surrey and will now be raffled to raise much needed funds to continue Landirani's work. Tickets are £1 each and can be bought everywhere that the Quilt is displayed as well as online via the Landirani shop. Of course you can buy as many tickets as you like to increase your chances of winning this beautiful quilt!

The Raffle for this quilt (and other prizes) will be drawn 2nd July at the Landirani Summer Indulgence.

Thanks and congratulations to everyone who has contributed their skills and creativity so far.
