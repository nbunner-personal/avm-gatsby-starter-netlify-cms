On the 15 JUNE 2019  we are once again holding our fantastic INDULGENCE DAY at 31 Upper Brighton Rd, Surbiton where therapists will be coming to donate their time and skill to help AVM  raise some much needed funds for the orphan & vulnerable in our area in Malawi.  There’ll also be some stalls, a beer tent, lunches & tea & cake.
