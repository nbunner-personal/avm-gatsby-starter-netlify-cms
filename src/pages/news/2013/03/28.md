[![Epilepsy Day](https://www.africanvision.org.uk/africa-vision-news/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/header_logo.jpg)](https://www.africanvision.org.uk/africa-vision-news/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/header_logo.jpg)26th March 2013 was World Epilepsy Day and many people don’t realise the problems people face with epilepsy in Malawi.  The problems are that many can’t get access to medication, therefore have constant seizures and this is dangerous in itself and they can fall in open fires while cooking.  They are often seen by the community to be possessed, and some even practice putting their limbs in a fire to burn out the evil spirit!  What we can do is educate people about the illness, build fuel saving ovens to protect during cooking, try to get better access to medication.  This does take money for hospitalisation, fuel for driving, paying for a epilepsy trainer, paying for ovens, etc. so if anyone can support us, please do so through our website.
