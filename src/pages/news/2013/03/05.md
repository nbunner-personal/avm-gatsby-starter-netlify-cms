We have a fantastic fundraiser Sarah Bowen who is cycling around the coast in 80 days this summer for us.  This will be a mega cycle ride of just under 4,000km!  The money she raises will go towards building our Training Village.

A few words from Sarah on her challenge; "I'm Sarah Bowen and I’m going to be doing a sponsored cycle ride around the coast of England and Wales this summer to raise money for the next stage in African Vision Malawi’s development which is to build a training village.  I hope to raise £20,000 which is a big ask and to put it in context that will mean cycling just under 4,000km in distance.  In terms of elevation it will be the height of Mt Everest x two and a half!  So am I a professional cyclist?  Far from it.

Now I am committed, committed to getting fit and to achieving this goal of raising £20,000 for the training village which will make such a radical difference to lives of so many individuals and their families both now and in the future."
