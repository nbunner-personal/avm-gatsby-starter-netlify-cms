Sam completed his ascent of Mont Blanc on Wednesday 21st August a day later than planned due to very high winds at the summit, after an arduous 13 hour climb on the final day. Sam is now halfway to his fundraising target of £5000 and we would love him to reach this goal too. You can read Sam's Mont Blanc blog [here](http://summitformalawi.wordpress.com/ "Sam's Mont Blanc blog").

If you haven't donated and would like to, we will keep the campaign running a little longer.You can donate towards Sam's climb [here](https://mydonate.bt.com/fundraisers/africanvisionclimb "Sam's climb")

Sam has also spent over £2000 of his own money to make this dream possible. If anyone feels like contributing a little towards that, I know he would be very grateful as he's now skint! To do this please contact him directly at [sam.palmer@africanvision.org.uk ](mailto:sam.palmer@africanvision.org.uk "Sam's Email address")

You will have the chance to win the use of a Yurt for a weekend. Sam has decided to spice things up a little by adding an incentive to your donating...for every £10 you donate to this cause you will get the equivalent of 1 ticket in a raffle to win Sam's beautiful hand-crafted Ash Yurt for a long weekend in September. It is 14ft in diameter and comfortably sleeps 4 people; it would be brilliant to use as a luxurious escape for a weekend, put up in the garden for the kids (or big kids) to play in, or for a corporate event…its uses are endless! [Read more...](http://summitformalawi.wordpress.com/ "Mont Blanc climb")
