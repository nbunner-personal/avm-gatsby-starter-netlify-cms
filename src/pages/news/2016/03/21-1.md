Shaughan Hawks is running the London Marathon for us this year!

[https://mydonate.bt.com/fundraisers/shaughanhawks1](https://mydonate.bt.com/fundraisers/shaughanhawks1)

His latest training run was the Maidstone road race Half Marathon yesterday.  He completed the course in 1hour 57mins, and this was his longest run so far.  He's got 5 weeks to go, and thinks he might sign up for another half marathon in two weeks time too.  That'll be on his birthday!

Shaughan ran with his friend Adam, and his mum ran the 10k race too!  Check out the photos of them below >
