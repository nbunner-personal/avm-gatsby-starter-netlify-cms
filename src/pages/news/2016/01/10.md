21 year old Alex Walker has signed up to run the Vitality North London Half Marathon for us on Sunday 20th March!

That's 13.1 miles, and it's his first time running a half marathon.  The finish line is in Wembley Stadium, which sounds like it will be quite something!  Good luck, Alex, and thank you for choosing us.

If you'd like to sponsor Alex, his fundraising page is [here](https://mydonate.bt.com/fundraisers/alexwalker1994).
