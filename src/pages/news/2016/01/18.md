There are so many ways you can support African Vision Malawi!

Here are some of the possibilities:

[Buy a Biogas Cow](#cow)
[Repair a windscreen](#windscreen)
[University scholarships](#university)
[Pre-school partnerships](#pre-school)
[Goats, nets and boreholes](#store)
[Old laptops and cameras](#laptops)

[Gift a legacy](#gift)

* We are building a sustainable biogas digester. [Buy a Biogas Cow](https://www.africanvision.org.uk/product/buy-a-cow/) to be a part of our herd!

* Donate £100 to repair our minibus windscreen. We use the minibus as the only form of transport available to take our disability patients to appointments in Lilongwe. With the rainy season now underway there is unfortunately every possibility that the windscreen will shatter soon.

* Sponsor a university or further education student. Students who have completed our secondary school scholarship programme are now studying Teaching, Nursing, Languages and Journalism. £40 a month will help support them.

* Do you know any UK pre-schools who would like to partner a Malawian pre-school in our area? [Email](mailto:info@africanvision.org.uk) us if so!

* Buy a goat, mosquito net or borehole for Malawi in our [Store](https://www.africanvision.org.uk/shop/). Ideal feel-good birthday gift!

* Do you have an old laptop or camera you could donate to us? We are always in need of laptops for the Lilongwe office and our sponsored University Students. If your laptop is less than 5 years old, we can gladly take it off your hands. We also need cameras so that we can record project progress for Monitoring and Evaluation and to report back to funders on the spending and impact of their funds. Mobile phones which have chargers and are unblocked are very useful too. [Email](mailto:info@africanvision.org.uk) us if you can help!

* Set up a monthly donation to support any and all of our work.

* Sign up to [Easy Fundraising](https://www.africanvision.org.uk/get-involved/fundraise-with-easy-fundraising/). Online stores (including Amazon, EBay, John Lewis, Sainsbury's, Waitrose....) donate a percentage of your shopping spend to African Vision Malawi at no extra cost to you.

* We are looking for Fundraisers, accountancy and office help in the UK. Are any of those positions right for you? [Read more here](https://www.africanvision.org.uk/get-involved/vacancies/).

* Pledge a gift to celebrate your birthday or wedding. Maybe leave a legacy in your will. [Read more here](https://www.africanvision.org.uk/celebrate-and-give/).

Can you help us in any of these ways? Thank you!
