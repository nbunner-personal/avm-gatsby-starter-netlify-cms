"Since form one, I had a desire to become a nurse and help people in hospitals and communities so I worked hard to accomplish my dream." - Loness Eliya

We have begun publishing a series of life stories of the University Students whom our supporters sponsor.

First is [Loness Eliya](https://www.africanvision.org.uk/projects/university-scholarships/loness-eliya-story-of-a-sponsored-university-student/), a nursing student at Kamuzu Central Hospital, who we also sponsored for her secondary education.

You can read all about her struggle to get an education [here](https://www.africanvision.org.uk/projects/university-scholarships/loness-eliya-story-of-a-sponsored-university-student/).
