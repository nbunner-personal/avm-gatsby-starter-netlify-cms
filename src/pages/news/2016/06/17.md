Our 6th Indulgence Day on 11th June 2016 was a great success!

Supporters came along and enjoyed therapies (courtesy of Sheer Therapy), haircuts (thanks to Lee the Barber), tea, cake and a beer tent, in the peaceful surroundings of Heather and Nigel Palmer's garden.

A wonderful day was had by all, and, just as importantly, supporters raised £1,545.45 and this money will enable us to run more Burns Prevention Workshops in our area.

Some photos of the day here:
