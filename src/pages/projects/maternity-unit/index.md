The opening of the Maternity Unit in M’bang’ombe was held on 12th November 2013 and was attended by Dorothy Ngoma, who is the President’s Advisor on Safe Motherhood. Amazingly the first baby was born in the unit that very day! This 10 bed unit is the first in our area to have lighting and internal running water via a solar pump.

During our 2015 Christmas Campaign, A Child is Born, we fundraised for resources to turn the neighbouring building into a Waiting Home to encourage women to come to the unit earlier than their due date. The building will also include observation rooms and an Under 5’s clinic and we will be running programmes so mothers can learn more about good nutrition. Building work will commence in 2017.

1 in 6 women die in childbirth in Malawi. Improving maternity care is so important.
