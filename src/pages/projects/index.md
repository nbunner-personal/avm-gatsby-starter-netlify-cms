      Education is free to children up to the end of primary school but if they
      want to go on and get a full education (and hopefully go onto university)
      it costs around £792 for four years at Secondary School This pays for
      school fees, exam fees, school materials, boarding fees, food and school
      uniform. We are currently sponsoring 28 teenagers to go to Secondary
      school.

      contamination. This is a great present for your friends and family as it
      is genuinely saving lives and we will have a plaque created with the name

      the well upon completion and send it to them.
